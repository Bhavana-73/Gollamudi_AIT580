I have corresponded with Discover Card at least four times since XXXX/XXXX/2015 ( which I have enclosed as an attachment to this complaint ). I believe that the credit card issuer has violated consumer protection laws by failing to implement the Special Rule for Credit Card Purchase protection despite overwhelming paperwork evidence submitted by me that shows the merchant has conducted business in bad faith less favorable to the consumer. I have sustained a monetary loss as a result of merchants bad faith and intent. I have patiently utilized the internal Discover Card dispute process over the past three months with the credit card issuer always favoring the merchant ; I have repeatedly submitted irrefutable paperwork evidence that has shown that the merchant has conducted business in bad faith. I have tried in good faith to address my complaint with the merchant and Discover Card but believe that I will not receive a favorable outcome.,,DISCOVER BANK,NV,891XX,,Consent provided,Web,03-04-2016,Closed with explanation,Yes,Yes,1816726

04/13/2018,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"I own a small trucking company. One of my trucks needed a repair. I hired a mechanic to do the repair on XX/XX/XXXX. He told us he installed new batteries and a new starter on the truck. The mechanic stated his work was guaranteed and I paid him with my TD Bank XXXX credit card {$2300.00} for this repair. When my driver went to start the truck for work the next day, the truck did not work/start again. We tried calling/texting mechanic to let him know the truck was not working even though the previous day he said he fixed the truck. I have the texts and phone records showing we were reaching out to the mechanic with no response from him. I had to hire another mechanic to fix truck again and found out the parts put in my truck by the first mechanic were wrong. I filed a dispute on XX/XX/XXXX for the above transaction with my TD Bank XXXX credit card. Even though I paid the first mechanic {$2300.00}, my dispute amount was for only {$1300.00} because that amount is for the wrong parts. The credit card company requested proof of records and a second estimate for work done on truck. I overnighted a package on XX/XX/XXXX to the credit card company. Within a day or two that is when the dispute department requested a second estimate. The dispute department stated I had only until XX/XX/XXXX to submit the second estimate documentation. So I faxed the second estimate on XX/XX/XXXX which was the same date the dispute department received my overnight package. When I called to followup on Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX the dispute department stated they never received second estimate needed for dispute, even though I had a fax confirmation transmission stating the fax was sent. So I sent fax again onXX/XX/XXXX ( which was the deadline for this documentation ) and received fax confirmation sheet stating the fax was sent. TD Bank XXXX credit card stated they never received second estimate in time and they closed my dispute. So even though I did everything they requested in the time they wanted because of the failure on their end with not receiving fax ( even though I have proof ), my company lost when I should be protected by the "" XXXX '' logo.",,TD BANK US HOLDING COMPANY,NJ,,,Consent provided,Web,04/16/2018,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,N/A,2874325

As a result of a series of legislation called Act 10, I was forced to take a cut in take home pay of almost XXXX per month. I immediately began trying to work with XXXX XXXX XXXX to modify my home loan into something affordable. I was told that I had to be 45 days behind in order to start a modification process, so I allowed myself to fall behind to start the process ( I was running about 29 days late prior ). After 3 years of attempting to work with them, including lost paperwork, inaccurate claims ( ie home vacant when it was n't ), and changes in case workers, etc I finally contacted my local State Representative who managed to get XXXX XXXX XXXX to work with me. XX/XX/XXXX, I finally had a modification offer but it modified my home to over {$170000.00}. My home is only worth about {$69000.00}. When I asked about modifying it down to what it was worth, I was told to sign the modification and then XXXX XXXX XXXX would work on adjusting the modification down to its value. The only reason the amount was so high was due to XXXX XXXX XXXX taking over 3 years to modify my mortgage and their ineptitude with the process. XX/XX/XXXX, I was offered a job in XXXX, ND which I then accepted. My preference at that time, would have been to have to modification at the value of my home and then to rent the home out. As XXXX XXXX XXXX refused to honor their earlier agreement of renegotiating the modification down to the value of the home, it has now fallen into foreclosure and is vacant. After XXXX XXXX XXXX sold my mortgage to Carrington Mortgage-while in the middle of a modification, in XXXX XXXX, I again attempted the process and was denied any options. When I called to work with the company, I was told, on several occasions, different things. Once I was told to go ahead and short sale it, only to receive a letter later stating that was not possible. I also received a letter stating that I did not qualify for any options. XX/XX/XXXX, I received notice from a law firm representing XXXX XXXX XXXX that my foreclosure was being reopened. In XX/XX/XXXX, I received the attached legal work stating the foreclosure was in the 3 month redemption. After contacting both Carrington and XXXX XXXX XXXX over the course of the last 4 months, I have been told each other owns the mortgage, no one has foreclosed, the process has not been started, it has been started, XXXX XXXX XXXX is not allowed to do that, we do n't own the loan, we do own the loan, etc. My last conversation with Carrington stated that they are selling the mortgage effective XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and will not do anything with it, while the attorney for XXXX XXXX XXXX is trying to move forward with the foreclosure. I have been dealing with this for almost 4 years, with no solution in sight when this should have been completed over 3 years ago. I have attached some of the RMAs, etc and have most paperwork available ( about XXXX pages worth ).",,"CARRINGTON MORTGAGE SERVICES, LLC",ND,585XX,,Consent provided,Web,11-01-2016,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,2189912

They could not answer that, and I requested to speak with the manager. Manager advised since this is a re-investigation, no runner is involved.

My monthly statements are consistently reflecting 2 months of payments due. I have contacted the mortgage company every month to better understand why this is occurring, as I am submitting my monthly payments well before the XXXX of each month. Initially i received a statement for XXXX reflecting 2 months due for my mortgage ( XXXX & XXXX ). I noted a correspondence that stated my loan was sold at the end of XXXX, but no account information provided by new service provider SUNTRUST. I reached out to SUNTRUST to make an online payment prior to XX/XX/XXXX to maintain my account current. In the XXXX billing statement I understood why system generated the dual payment due as the conversion time being noted. However for the XXXX Billing statement did not understand why still showing 2 payments being due. I contacted SUNTRUST on XX/XX/XXXX and was told my billing cycle was occurring every XXXX of the month, as this was automatically set-up by the system. Additionally I had mailed hard-copy checks this month, as needed to make up an escrow shortage. Understanding this billing cycle I sent my XXXX payment on XX/XX/18 via epay for XXXX XXXX account.

Each year after 12 months of consecutive payments, I have called Mr Cooper to request the credit. I have always had automatically payments set up with them so all payments have been on time. They always tell me that I am only eligible after the full 5 years of payments is completed. I am now beyond the 5 years since origination. I have been trying to contact Mr Cooper regarding my incentive credit under the program. Mr Cooper representatives keep saying it will be processed shortly and that I will receive written notice. I have not received anything in over 5 years and have been calling every month or two for status for the last 4 yrs. They refuse to put anything in writing even after numerous request for written confirmation they are processing the incentive credit. Mr Cooper 's website does not have option to send email so that I can receive written response. I have tried to calling Making Homes Affordable counselor for assistance, but they have been unwilling to help, but did tell me that the lender is suppose to give me the credit each year after consecutive 12 monthly payments are made on time, not after 60 months. They also indicated that I should also be eligible for up to {$5000.00} credit if I make 12 consecutive payments on time in the 6th year.

This company never sent any correspondence to me that would have informed me of any alleged debt they were attempting to collect. Further, by not receiving any correspondence from them, did not allow me to dispute the validity of their claim. to that end, I submitted a dispute to XXXX XXXX ( although the company was truly Accelerated Receivables ), the address reflected was to Accelerated Receivables. This too is a violation. If they are attempting to collect on a debt, then their name should have been listed and not the alleged original creditor. Accelerated Receivables never responded. So I then sent a copy of the certified letter with return receipt to XXXX to verify that the company did not respond to my dispute letter and the entries should be deleted. The entries were deleted from XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I again retrieved a copy of my report an found that Accelerated Receivables had reported these same 4 derogatory accounts, that do not belong to me, on my XXXX   report. I disputed with XXXX but to no avail. XXXX responded well after 30 days only to state the accounts were verified. I submitted a response to their findings by inquiring as to how they were able to get a response from Accelerated and my efforts were not successful as the company just blatantly disregarded my dispute. I then escalated this dispute to the CFPB against XXXX and at XXXX ( as it appeared on my credit report ). It took XXXX over 60 days to respond to the CFPB only to state that they would send a letter with the results from the investigation to me. Again, I received the same letter whereby XXXX stated the accounts were mine. 

I then sent Accelerated Receivables another letter ( second attempt ) dated XX/XX/XXXX whereby I once again requested that they provide validation of these entries belonging to me. This letter was sent certified with a return receipt and to date, I have not received any correspondence from this company. Additionally, I requested that they provide a copy of the financial responsibility page for the accounts they are alleging I owe. Again, to no avail.

She could not explain why my daughter 's SSN would be in their system. She said that I would need to call Equifax directly, but she did not even have the number to call. 

Trying to contact Equifax directly has been futile. They have deliberately obfuscated any direct way of contacting them. So far, I can not even determine a simple question -- does the SSN associated with my baby have any credit history or other association with Equifax? According to one rep, the answer should be "" no, '' but she can not confirm it. 

So far, the only way I think I may get any answers is sending copies of important, sensitive documents ( my and my daughter 's SS cards, birth certificates, etc ) directly to Equifax.

08/22/2016,Credit reporting,,Credit reporting company's investigation,Problem with statement of dispute,"I am filing this complaint because ChexSystems has demonstrated some seriously broken "" investigative '' processes of consumer initiated disputes. ChexSystems does not follow a well articulated investigative process, but instead launch "" re-investigations '' on their own accord without the consumers request, that yield differing results than prior investigations. They refuse to provide information to consumers that substantiate the outcome of their investigations. Sadly, Chex also adds inaccurate information to consumer files at the whim of their broken administrative processes. 

ChexSystems absolves themselves of any responsibility for the accuracy of information contained in their systems, but instead casts responsibility to their customers, and forces the consumer to address problems directly with ChexSystems customers, unless providing a police report. Unfortunately some police agencies do n't issue "" police reports '' when a crime has not been clearly consummated. In some cases a consumer may want to guard against the release of accurate consumer information to prevent perpetuating additional fraud. 

Having gone through investigations with XXXX other Credit Reporting Agencies over the same set of fraudulent inquiries without a "" police report '', ALL of the interactions with other Credit Reporting Agencies were consumer friendly, were well defined, were conducted in a professional manner without putting personal information at risk, did not require "" re-investigations '', and resulted in the complete removal of all fraudulent and inaccurate information in my consumer file at their firms. 

Details of the interactions with ChexSystems are contained in the attached file. ChexSystems does not provide direct contact information to a consumer to consult directly with a ChexSystems employee.

Today when I called to ask about the cancelled payment, I was told that my money would be returned in 7 to 14 days. After 14 days, I checked and discovered that my refund has not been processed. On this call, I was told that ( 1 ) the refund request was being reviewed, ( 2 ) the review process can take 10 days and ( 3 ) if the review results in a refund, it will take 30 days for that refund to be issued. 

I was concerned because none of this information was shared in my previous call. I asked the customer service if the process for refunds was listed online because I would like to review it.

06/21/2016,Bank account or service,Checking account,Problems caused by my funds being low,,"I have come to realize Chase bank has been rearranging the order of my transactions to maximize fees and it has snowballed out of control. I understand I have agreed to an over draft type of protection that I am charged a fee of {$34.00} when used. However, I did not agree to allow Chase to rearrange the order of my transactions to maximize fees. When I attempt to make a purchase or pay a bill using my bank card and there are not enough funds in my account my transaction is declined. I first realized something was amiss XXXX. I could not figure out why I had so many overdraft fees for transactions that I knew I had funds to cover and were approved. I went to the branch to sit down and go over each item with their representative. Neither he, his manager nor I could figure out how this happened but they were kind ( I think due to my being unemployed ) and credited me XXXX or XXXX of the many fees. When looking at the transactions as they were listed on my account it all made sense. However, when trying to get to the root of the problem I struggled - I knew I had adequate funds when I proceeded with the transactions and how could the transaction be approved if I was in the negative? Now that I closely monitor my account I have learned in the last few weeks that Chase rearranges the order transactions are posted and I firmly believe it is to maximize fees which I consider to be a predatory banking practice. They post larger dollar amount transactions first that snowball into {$34.00} fees for {$9.00} or {$10.00} transactions that would not be approved if funds were not available. In one instance One week I paid bills, grocery shopped and withdrew {$20.00} from my account. I did all this early in the week. All transactions were approved by the bank and all reflected on my account ( transactions are reflected same day ). A few days later I paid a bill that I knew I would utilize OD protection. Chase rearranged the transactions posting the higher bill payment first causing a {$34.00} fee, then {$100.00} transaction causing another {$34.00} fee then the {$9.00} and {$20.00} transactions charging XXXX more fees. My account had funds to cover all transactions when they occurred ( except the bill payment that occurred days after the other transactions ) and they were originally showing in the chronological order the transactions happened with a correct balance. I called the bank to review this with them detailing when transactions actually happened and how it originally showed correct chronological order and how the order changed after the bill payment but unfortunately I am dissatisfied with the outcome. They see no wrong doing on their part and because I already had XXXX courtesy credits of fees ( maximum allowed within a 12 month time frame ) they wo n't consider refunding more. I now do not consider the refunds I received in XXXX as a courtesy nor do I consider my current request as a courtesy because of their deliberate practice being a means to maximize fees. I have been charged approximately XXXX {$34.00} fees in the last month or so of which only XXXX are valid. This is more than my unemployment check. In addition, they have not covered all checks despite my having over draft protection. They returned a check but still charged me {$34.00} for returned check fee.",,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,NJ,,,Consent provided,Web,06/21/2016,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1978474

Research after research on various student loan plans, I contacted Navient to inquire about the Income Base program. Again, they graciously enrolled me into the Income Based program, which resulted in payments of aproximately {$1300.00}, which again, I could not afford to pay. The {$1300.00} payment was based on both mine and my husband 's income. I immediately notified Navient to inform them that my husband too had student loans with Navient and XXXX. Thus, my payment was reduced to {$900.00}. I am currently XXXX years old soon to turn XXXX in XXXX 2017. My student debt has placed a burden on my marriage and my health.

I was told that this card came with overdraft protection to protect overdrafts from my checking account with the same institution. Meanwhile, I had my first credit card setup to pay the balance in full. In short, money was transferred from checking to clear the balance on the first card, and this pulled credit from the other card, which came with biannual fees and raising my interest rate from 19 % to 26 %. When I tried, numerous times over the years, to address this with Chase they ignored me, or diverted the issue. Interest rates are a function of risk.

I filed my complaint on the following basis. 
1. Did XXXX sent me a letter in regards to Treasury Offset ( TOP ) 2. Transworld never advised per letter that they will collect on debt 3. Transworld added further fees to benefit themselves at my expense. 
4. Any attempt to contact XXXX to re solve this matter was not accomplished. 
XXXX  refused to assist on resolving my concerns with the excuse by customer service that I was fully aware of a debt. 
5. Attempt to communicate with Transworld was with excuses to collect and I spoke to a supervisor that refuse to assist in resolving the matter any further. I was treated unfairly and with disrespect. 
Soon after I filed my complaint with the FTC consumer complaint ( XX/XX/XXXX ) the following occurred. 

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, provided me copies of Transworld debt collection ( itemized ) they continue by saying of Federal laws protecting my rights but my rights were not protected why I tried to resolve this matter before my complaints. Secondly, all documents received by CFPB and attached to me on the resolution could not be read. Why CFPB did not notice this matter. 

XXXX, then proceeded to send me documents of the same attachment. XXXX  sent statements and a letter in small font ( required magnifying glass to read ) and if I had concerns of my right to communicate this with XXXX, again prior to my complaint, I called XXXX trying to resolve this matter and they continue to say you know you had a debt! Why call if they will not listen to me and try to get this matter without a third party collection. 

The problem, I read per XXXX  letter provided by Transworld XX/XX/XXXX XXXX  : if you do not pay your debt or take other actions described below within 60 days from the date of this Letter. ( XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ) 60 days from XX/XX/XXXX is the first week of XX/XX/XXXX. The agreement has been violated and the law broken. Both XXXX and Transworld has conspired to insure my Federal Tax Refund is taken away regardless of the agreement set forth in XXXX  letters.

That amount as principal is not possible -- based on the declared principal at the time of my original purchase and the new principal due per the work out plan. 
The bank, under the direction of the Federal Bankruptcy court for mediation, finally offered me a workout plan based on the bank 's determination of the current value of my home. To my knowledge, there was NO independent appraisal. That mediated agreement was signed XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

The details for that FUTURE workout plan included the bank 's claim that I owed {$290000.00}. I do not know how they made up this number. There was never a time when I owed such an amount as principal. 

The original note I signed in XXXX was for a principal amount of {$180000.00}. The new principal amount from the XXXX agreement is {$120000.00} ( interest bearing ) + {$13000.00} ( non-interest bearing ). 

That is a difference of {$49000.00} in principal. Where the {$150000.00} claimed as PRINCIPAL by the bank came from is a complete mystery. It seems the bank can make up whatever numbers they like and make whatever claims they wish and too bad for the consumer. 

First, I 'm told by the bank contact provided that I will have an answer by XXXX XXXX. -- to the simple question I asked in XXXX. 

Then, I receive a notice that it will be XXXX XXXX. 

Today, I received a notice today that the bank will contact me sometime within 60 days. 

It took the bank TWO months to send a notice that they will respond sometime in the next TWO Months? What then? Another notice that the bank will take another 6 months to send another notice? 

This is not reasonable. The bank has the information -- they had it when the provided the work-out plan -- in XXXX XXXX and they had it when they sent the confirming paperwork in XXXX of XXXX and they had it when they sent the final paperwork in XXXX of XXXX. The bank is refusing to disclose essential financial information to me - the consumer.

The first time I contacted MM was in XX/XX/XXXX and requested, for XXXX to correct the loan and monthly payment amount, they corrected the loan amount and still had the incorrect monthly payment. I was checking my credit back in XX/XX/XXXX, still was not fixed I waited and check again in XX/XX/XXXX and notice again the information was wrong with XXXX XXXX, so I contacted the business and Experian to report incorrect information on my credit with XXXX XXXX, once again the loan and the monthly payment amount was incorrect. I spoke with XXXX and she told me XXXX   have changed their reporting company due to issues, so I asked her why I have to keep dealing with this issue, she stated I wasn't the only one dealing with the issue, as if I was supposed to feel better. Then she proceed to tell me I need to contact the Credit Agency and dispute, well I had already filed the dispute twice and this would be the 3rd time  disputing. When I called Experian they told me to contact the Business, so I contacted XXXX again she was very rude, when I was telling her this information about my credit and that their company is reporting fraudulent information.

04/23/2019,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"Loan Number XXXX Property Address XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, WV XXXX NationStar : XXXX Starting XX/XX/XXXX, I established up a bimonthly payment process to maximize my payments against the interest for the year for a secondary property. The XX/XX/XXXX payment was not processed correctly because, according to Nationstar Mortgage LLC a subservicer for XXXX, their systems aren't able to process bimonthly payments. I have a mortgage with XXXX XXXX for a primary residence and not having an issue with them. 

This is what happened with Nationstar : My initial payment transmitted on XX/XX/XXXX electronically. Because it was a half payment, Nationstar applied it to XX/XX/XXXX as a principal payment. Because Nationstar processed it as a XX/XX/XXXX payment, I started receiving phone calls from Nationstar, even though the grace period through the XXXX of the month, hadn't passed, advising me that I was delinquent. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter stating that I was delinquent for the month of XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, the second part of my payment was processed for the XX/XX/XXXX payment. On XX/XX/XXXX, Nationstar generated a letter stating that I was assessed a {$15.00} late fee on my account, my account was delinquent and placed the 2nd part of my payment in an unapplied accounts fund. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted Nationstar, they advised me that their systems can't accommodate bimonthly payments. They had to move the 1st part of the XXXX payment that they applied to XX/XX/XXXX to the XX/XX/XXXX payment and removed the {$15.00} late fee. They advised that I should pay more each month to accomplish what I am attempting to accomplish to save on interest since their systems can't accommodate. 

Because Nationstar can't accommodate bimonthly payments, they aren't depositing funds into my account when processed to prevent further accrual of interest against the principal on my accounts ; therefore, penalizing the customer for system issues that they can't support. 

I attempted to escalate to the XXXX Executive Team, but was transferred back to Nationstar Executive Team. I am requesting that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Nationstar Mortgage LLC, XXXX TX be investigated for their payment processing practices. The loan papers do not indicate that bimonthly payments can not be processed and that full payments are expected or funds will be put into an unapplied accounts fund.

He informed me that I did not have to have a license contractor to do work in the house. I could choose who I wanted or do it myself. 
I immediately called Chase, told them I flooded, have a check coming and asked what did I need to do.

She said ( the second time I have been told this ) that the notes say the inspection was cancelled because they tried to contact me. Thats what Ive been told both times. She said that the reason was probably because I still didnt have a licensed contractor, even though it was noted otherwise. I never had any calls from inspectors or messages even though they said I had at least 6 calls concerning. I asked to speak with a supervisor, got XXXX XXXX, resolution specialist/account supervisor. Needed a license and the request was never approved. She said you can request anything you want, doesnt mean youre going to get it. Thats the point of a request.

Though if she switched me over to self-contracting, that I couldnt use the insurance check site and had to pay all out of pocket first then get submitted when totally done. I said I dont feel comfortable switching, I need to speak with my lawyer on what I should do because a ) I need an electronic record of everything and self-contracting relies on faxing and mail b ) how do I can I be ensured the money will come to me at the end? She said she was going to call XXXX to see if instead of a license he could produce proof of insurance / surety bond. I said feel free. She said that would work to release my funds.

03/26/2016,Credit reporting,,Credit reporting company's investigation,Problem with statement of dispute,"Overview of Problem -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Despite providing clear and convincing evidence that proves beyond any doubt that I paid a lien in XXXX XXXX, Equifax will not change my credit report to reflect the correct payment date. 


Details -- -- -- - I paid a XXXX ( XXXX ) state tax lien in full XXXX XXXX. 

The XXXX failed to report the payment to the XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) for recording until XXXX XXXX, over 2 years late. 

Because the XXXX records the release date as the date the XXXX transmits the information, the public record reports the release date as XXXX XXXX. 

After the release was filed in XXXX XXXX, I requested the XXXX record a corrected document stating the proper release date of XXXX XXXX. 

The XXXX would not record a corrected release, so I requested help from the XXXX commissioner in correcting this error. The XXXX was successful in getting the XXXX to add a notation to the official record that the payment was made in XXXX XXXX, but the XXXX still would not refile the release with the correct date. 

I submitted a request to Equifax that this be changed on my credit report. The result stated that the item was reporting correctly and thus was not removed. The notation made by the XXXX was evidently not enough proof. 

In XXXX, I wrote to the new XXXX commissioner. This resulted in the local XXXX providing a signed letter stating that the improper recording date was not my fault, and that I paid the full amount in XXXX XXXX. 

I again submitted a dispute to Equifax. 

Equifax responded stating the item was not even reporting on my credit file. I have to assume they did not understand how to cross-reference the XXXX records with the XXXX 's records. I then called Equifax at the number provided and spoke to two phone representatives. Neither provided satisfactory answers to my questions and I requested a supervisor. I was transferred to someone in Equifax 's office of consumer affairs ( name withheld ). This person was professional and courteous, and helpful to a point. 

The person listened to my concerns, but even with the clear evidence including an original, signed copy of the letter from the XXXX stating the correct payment date, the person would not make the correction. The person agreed to resubmit the dispute to the XXXX with all of the information I had provided. 

The result of their new investigation was the same. They still claim the item is reporting correctly and will not remove it from my report. 

To recap, the XXXX may be the reporting agency, but they are NOT the party to which the money was owed. In the mind of the XXXX, they are reporting the item correctly. However, the party to which the money was owed, the XXXX, confirms payment was made in full in XXXX XXXX. The XXXX also acknowledges it did not transmit the payoff information to the XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) in a timely manner for recording. In fact, it was over 2 years late. 

Therefore, this item 's payment date should be reflected correctly on my credit report. If so, it will be well past the seven year threshold for removal. 

Companies that wield as much power over consumers as does Equifax should be held to an extremely high standard. In my opinion, the company falls well below such a standard. They have not gone beyond a cursory check of public records to examine the evidence I 've provided and report this item correctly in my credit file. This practice is resulting in derogatory information on my credit report which should not be included. 

The XXXX has attempted to help me twice to correct their error. I want Equifax to do the right thing and correct my report.

04-11-2017,Debt collection,Credit card,Disclosure verification of debt,Not given enough info to verify debt,"This is in rebuttal to response from original complaint # XXXX. 
First off, I find it offensive and insulting that in the response to my original complaint, you essentially call me a liar as indicated by ( and I quote ) '' Mr. XXXX mentioned that he believed this was used by an "" unauthorized user '' and also that "" it seems unlikely that an unauthorized user would continue to pay on the account '' .You see, unlike you, it is not what I speculate or guess to be, it is instead, what I know. It seems to me that your respondent must truly feel a high degree of certainty that he/she is correct. When in fact, I can assure you, that you do not know my personal circumstances and what events have caused this debt to be what it is. Stick to the facts and the facts are this - you still have not complied with my request for itemized charges, signatures and dates of purchase so that I may differentiate charges that I know to be mine and then those that are unauthorized. Did it ever occur to you people that the unauthorized user may be somebody close to me and that knew me intimately and also knew how to make payments enough to avoid detection? Or maybe, I kept paying the monthly bill not paying close attention to the increasing amount? At any rate, you seem to have it all figured out..except for the part where you comply with my request to simply get itemized charges and dates. 
I find it aggravating and frustrating that after repeated attempts, I still am not getting what I have repeatedly requested. In fact, it seems now to have become a game and a personal attack on me. Why do n't you people simply provide what I have asked for and quit playing your little games. 
Again and again and again ... XXXX, I do not dispute that the account is mine. I simply want documentation of itemized charges and the dates of purchase. Why do I want these? I want these because in order for me to submit a police report or affidavit, I need these to show the facts. Can I be any clearer? 
Also in closing, your response states that you included documents to support your response which include a debt validation letter, a credit card application and lastly, billing statements. TO WHOM, I DID NOT GET ANYTHING? In fact, what good do any of these do for me anyway? I already said that I acknowledge being the owner of the account. The statements do n't show itemized charges and dates of purchase. 
DO YOU KNOW THAT NOT ONCE HAS THERE BEEN ANY ATTEMPT TO PUT ME IN TOUCH WITH YOUR FRAUD UNIT OR REQUEST A FRAUD AFFIDAVIT FROM ME. I have had to do this with a few other situations on my credit and they kindly listen to me, acknowledge my situation and give me advice and directions on how to obtain the information I am looking for. And do you know that as a result of this, they have acknowledged the unauthorized use on these accounts and have since remedied the situation. BUT NOT YOU! I ca n't even get detailed information from you and then on top of it, you make judgements and attack me personally. 
I 'm giving you one last opportunity to give me the information I am requesting or I will take legal action against your firm. Hopefully, this is something you can understand?",,"The Bureaus, Inc.",TX,782XX,,Consent provided,Web,04-11-2017,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,2429829

In phone communications with them, I was told they were refusing to do anything about the false report until we served them with proof that the credit bureaus contacted them and then gave us 5th 3rd Banks written reply. XXXX  immediately removed the false report from their listing. XXXX took my complaint three separate times and only sent back emails stating that the process was completed, but not once reporting what was the reply. In a fourth contact, by phone, they would not give the reply verbally and stated I would get a written copy in 3 to 10 business days. That was over three weeks ago. Now, by phone, they tell me I am no longer able to confirm who I am to begin any discussion of 5th3rds response or what happened to the promised written reply.

11/13/2017,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Banking errors,"Re : Complaint Against Bank of America Institution On XX/XX/XXXX I received a personal check in the amount of {$100.00}. I have the Bank of America App on my Smartphone device and I used this app to deposit the check into my checking account as I normally do when receiving a personal check. The only difference is that I split the check to put {$50.00} into checking and {$50.00} into my savings account. I received a confirmation that this had been done. Two days later while checking my account I found that the monies did not go into either account but instead Bank of America took {$100.00} out of my savings and {$100.00} out of my checking account and then placed a hold on both accounts.
It took two days and multiple calls and even visiting a local branch before theyd agree to put my monies back into my account that they illegally took out. Mind you though that they still had a hold on my check. At the advice of the rep I spoke to over the phone, the suggestion was made that I go into the bank and present the physical check to them and the hold would come off, but this never happened. The took my physical check and deposited and a day later I found it was rejected and that the initial 10-day hold would still be in effect. The monies from the check has come out the account of the person that gave me the check over a week ago and Bank of America is still insisting on holding the check until XX/XX/XXXX. The reason they are holding the check is merely because I tried to split the check between two accounts. Their app allowed me to do this and even gave me a confirmation that it was done.
I called again today and spoke with a supervisor who called their Risk Department and I was advised that they couldnt release my funds because they didnt have a good image of the check. This upset me because it was a lie. They had perfect image from my phone deposit and they have the physical check from the bank.
My main concern and contention is that if were not allowed to split checks why does your banking app initially allow it? Why wouldnt you put a disclaimer on the site, so your customers dont have to go thru this? And if this is the banking institutions failure why as the consumer must we suffer for it? And heres the biggest thing. Bank of America has had my XXXX for over a week making interest off it and refusing to give it to me until theyre ready which will be XX/XX/XXXX. This is illegal and although its only a XXXX my rights are being violated and Im thinking of seeking legal counsel. The rep on the phone told me that this happens all the time, and she agreed that they should do something about it, but they dont? The reason they dont is because theyre benefiting. I want to make sure they dont do this to other people.

It would be a consulting business run by my sons and using my years of experience and lessons learned to advise organizations on how to quickly solve ongoing problems while making their employees happy. 

I started to organize the new business, never having owned my own business before, by using on-line companies who help new businesses get started. I started by using XXXX to create an LLC. They recommended using XXXX to do the accounting work for my new business. Then It was recommended that I use Bank of America 's Small Business Banking Services to help me start using XXXX XXXX ( which was new to me ) and Checking. So I contacted them explaining I had never had my own business before and was n't sure what to do. 

Bank of America had me talk to a number of people in different departments to get started, but it was a confusing and complicated process, and I was never sure what was going on, and told them so. Then, having conducted no business at all with them or anyone connected to them, Bank of America sent me a notice that I had overdrawn my account and owed them money. I tried calling to clear up this error on their part but kept getting transferred to other people. Now I have a bill in the mail saying I still owe them for overdrawing my account. I am attaching their latest warning with this application for help. 

Thank you very much.

I have included the certified mail receipt and copy of the authorization mailed to XXXX XXXX XXXX After that I waited for the debit to come through it was n't until XXXX/2017 that the debit came through but it hit as a charge from LCA. At the time I did n't know who that was until the bank told me. I then filed a complaint with my bank of an unauthorized transaction by this LCA, as I have no business with them nor have I ever heard of them. I sent authorization to XXXX XXXX to collect a debt and they did n't get it so I thought. So the bank refunded my bank account when I advised them of this. They told me they were n't able to stop the payment so as a result they closed the card associated with the transaction and paid this company who stole from my account because XXXX XXXX gave them my banking information. So on XXXX XXXX  2017 I paid the original creditor via bill pay sent by my bank as a check to settle the debt and again XXXX XXXX sent the check to LCA. I found this out when I received the check mailed to the original creditor in an envelope from LCA stating it is not acceptable as you will see in the documentation I 'm uploading. Therefore LCA is reporting inaccurate information to the credit bureaus in an effort to harm my credibility. I paid this account to the original creditor upon being notified of the balance. They maliciously sent the payment to LCA not once but twice in an effort to discredit me. It is n't right. LCA has already stolen from me and now they have the audacity to report a paid debt to an original creditor ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) as a collection when they know this creditor actually gave them money for a paid account. I have never and will never do business with a collection agency because I pay my bills when I am informed of them. Plain and simple I knew there was a bill and I paid it and LCA has clearly violated FCRA regulations by reporting to a third party a debt they know is paid in an effort to assist XXXX XXXX XXXX with this fraudulent claim of debt. I demand that LCA remove this fraudulent and illegal information from my credit report. The account has been paid to XXXX XXXX twice and here is the proof sent to me by LCA from the original creditor. I have never had any business with LCA and will not. I 'm not liable for how an original creditor handle payments and aside from this LCA is reporting inaccurate amounts.

Transunion has failed to do this, so I am requesting that the Bankruptcy is permanently removed from my credit file. After reviewing my Transunion credit report, I noticed that the public record does not include my name, address and either my social security number.

07/23/2018,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Getting a credit card,Application denied,"Greetings! I have recently filed a complaint with CFPB, case # XXXX, and have receive a very unclear response. Since the company in question, CITI BANK does not reply to my follow up, not XXXX XXXX XXXX has ever picked up the phone, I am submitting another letter with more precise follow up questions. 

To recap : my XXXX credit card application was denied solely for the reason of my citizenship and/or immigration status. 

XXXX XXXX, please, address the following questions with as much precision as you can to help me fully understand the reason for the inability of your company to continue with the process : 1. In your original letter, you mentioned that "" due to the United States laws and regulations pertaining to transactions with or in XXXX ''. QUESTION 1 : what laws and regulations you are referring to? Please, cite names and numbers, if applicable, so I can familiarize with them. NOTE : I have never heard of any such U.S. laws as I presently have and had in the past credit cards with all major banks. QUESTION 2 : if such laws and regulations exist, are other banks exempt from them? 

2. I would like to clarify the actual reason for the denial. To my knowledge, the bank is NOT making transactions WITH XXXX, NOR IN XXXX. I am a private citizen and live in the US for many years, I am a resident of this country and pay taxed as a resident. The back of the letter you sent me explicitly states that ECOA prohibits discrimination based on many factors, including national origin, provided the applicant has the capacity to enter into a binding contract. In my opinion, my credit records do show my capabilities and trustworthiness, unless you can present a reason why you would think otherwise. QUESTION 3 : how come your sole reason for the denial is my citizenship/immigration status? Isn't that a direct violation of the ECOA laws? I say : look at my credit score, not my passport! 

3. I was speaking several times with CITI BANK representatives and have been told repeatedly that CITI does not discriminate, even though in my mind, this is a direct discrimination based on citizenship status. QUESTION 4 : to help me better understand the discriminatory policy, please, provide a hypothetical example, where your company would indeed discriminate someone based on the same factor. 

4. QUESTION 5 : does CITI BANK have a unified policy towards ALL applicants? What I mean is whether any non-US citizen or XXXX XXXX holder is not able to obtain a XXXX credit card? Or Ukrainian citizens are in a specific list, for which CITI BANK does not want to open accounts?

02/22/2018,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"We had an existing Mortgage loan through XXXX XXXX XXXX that originated in XX/XX/XXXX. It was purchased, to our knowledge, in XX/XX/XXXX. At that time, unknown to us, we were one month behind on our payments to XXXX due to a missed payment in XX/XX/XXXX due to an Illness. The payment was overlooked and we were never contacted by XXXX by letter, email or phone to be able to address the Issue and make the missed payment. We have since learned about the missed payment after hiring Council. Only then did Seterus inform us of the missed payment. We have since rectified the missed payment on XX/XX/XXXX for {$2600.00}. We also gave Seterus specific instructions in writing on the cashiers check that the money was to go to the XX/XX/XXXX missed payment or was not to be cashed. Seterus refused to abide by the instructions on the check and cashed the check anyway. When ask why, they explained that wasnt the way they did their accounting and the money was placed into a existing Suspense Account. 
In XX/XX/XXXX XXXX  notified us by letter that the loan had been purchased and we were to begin making our payments to Seterus in XX/XX/XXXX. We never received any correspondence from Seterus at that time. We didnt receive a new contract to sign so we assumed Seterus had adopted the same contract we had with XXXX XXXX XXXX. We complied with the letter from XXXX and set up an account on the Seterus Website and began making our payments on XX/XX/XXXX even though we hadnt received a statement from Seterus at the time. It wasnt until after we had made XXXX payment, that we received XXXX statement from Seterus. They had Immediately began charging us a late fee and demanded a {$7900.00} payment that was due XX/XX/XXXX. When we contacted them about the amount, their response was that we had missed our  XXXX payment and we also had to reimburse them for the Escrow disbursement of {$5900.00} and {$280.00}. We explained to them at that time, our payment had been made on-line to them on XX/XX/XXXX as we were instructed to do. We also explained that the Escrow payment should have come from our existing Escrow account with XXXX. Those explanations fell on deaf ears. We received our first of three statements for XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX showing we owed {$7900.00} for XXXX payment. This statement also included prior activity with Seterus, although we had never done business with before, showing a XXXX payment and XXXX payment of {$2600.00} respectively. The Statement also showed two Tax Disbursement made on XX/XX/XXXX for  {$5900.00} and {$280.00}. Money, we thought, should have come from funds in our Escrow account  with XXXX. After visiting our Tax Assessor about the Issue, the Tax Assessor explained to us that only two payments had been recorded to our account on XX/XX/XXXX. Both being by Seterus. Meaning that XXXX XXXX XXXX did not make our XX/XX/XXXX tax payment and were still in possession of account funds or Seterus was withholding Escrow funds and refusing to tell us and then demanding we pay them for the dispersed funds. Only after a Escrow Account statement showing a {$7800.00} surplus, did Seterus acknowledge the existence of the funds and after request from council, still refused to refund us our money until we had paid them what they said we owed them. Money that was never owed to them in the first place.

Seterus continues to engage in unscrupulous tactics to get us to pay money that is not owed to them. Seterus continually threatens to foreclose on our home every month and continually sends us unsolicited offers for a Loan Modification that we have never requested, wanting to lower our payments by extending our note to forty years. Seterus continues to harm our credit rating by reporting us late on our payments which has caused us unneeded expenses. We are unable to refinance our Mortgage at the present lower interest rate because of this also. They refuse to acknowledge our Attorney and our Accountant, that we have paid hundreds of dollars for, even after Seterus was sent documentation by our CPA verifying their mistake.

We respectfully request your help in rectifying this unfortunate issue as soon as possible so we may be able to go on with our lives without fear of having our home taken from us and our credit continually being ruined.

It 's known as "" income-driven '' repayment and is touted by the Education Department as a way to keep those borrowers out of default. Nelnet made it difficult for me to arrange any type income-based payment and continued to steer me only into forbearance arrangements and eventually turned into costly payment instead of affordable long-term repayment options that were more beneficial to Nelnet. Nelnet failed to disclose their annual deadline to renew or obscured its renewal notice and recently is the center of a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court.

I called Elan Financial Service on   XXXX   to dispute the sales. I clearly said I did make the charges or know the merchant. Elan did not transfer the handling to their fraud group, but only attempted to get copies of sales.
They were then unable to obtain the sales copies, but deem the sales valid and reapplied to my account (  XXXX  ). I then called again (  XXXX  ), this time the representative said both sales would be handling as fraud, closed my account, and sent me new credit cards.
In watching my statement, it appeared that they only began handling one of the {$75.00}, as demonstrated by only a single temporary credit.
Again, I called to speak with the fraud group (  XXXX  ). This time I was told that the second charge would be handled as fraud and that the "" investigator '' would return my call. No call was received.
Today (  XXXX  ), I had to call again, as the second {$75.00} is still on the account and I did not received a call as promised after 12-days. This time I was told that the investigator tried to call ( 07/05 ) but could not connect AND they only make one attempt. This is unfair as it requires the customer to ensure follow-up by the bank.

On the the interest, I logged on recently and noticed my rate is now 29 % ( apr I believe ). I think if anything, and according to the Obama Credit Card reform act, my rate, after paying more than the first six months off on time ( Im almost positive if not more than six ) should have gone down. I havent kept track so much but I doubt I had started with 29 % rate. So to sum up, please lower the rate based on the law I mention, and refund the interest and late fees.

06/19/2018,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"My credit card was charged by the vendor XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX for the amount of {$11000.00} for the purchase of an aquamarine center stone and diamond ring. The ring was advertised and valued at {$68000.00}. After engaging a reputable local appraiser, I discovered the ring was falsely advertised as an aquamarine and dimanond ring. It was in fact a topaz and diamond ring of a much lesser value ( approx. {$7900.00} ).  I engaged the seller who recognized the mistake, took the ring back and acknowledged to refund me the {$11000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. As of today I did not received the refund. 

I opened a dispute with citicard on XX/XX/XXXX and provided very detailed documentation of the purchase ( 28 pages in total ), appraisals of the ring, confirmation of the return of the ring to XXXX XXXX XXXX  and email traffic between me and the seller, who acknowledged receiving the ring and to refund me the {$11000.00}. 

I called and chatted with the citicard dispute office in 3 occasions just to make sure they had everything they needed. The answer was always yes and that they would come back to me with a resolution. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, without any previous notice, I received an email from citicard that 2 of the 28 pages I've sent them were not readable and declined my dispute. The {$11000.00} were back on my credit card. I called citicard dispute office to verify my next step and after receiving instructions I resubmitted all the documentation again with a "" more readable '' version of the two pages they were questioning about. I called and talked to two dispute specialists again who ensured me that all the pages now were readable and that another specialist would get back to me in a few days. The people I've interacted with so far don't seem to even read my emails or the documentation I've provided. One of them even told me that my documentation never made it to the seller financial institution. Between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX nobody at citicard even looked at the details of my dispute. 

This should be an easier resolution considering I've returned the ring to the seller and I've the message from the seller acknowledging the ring was not a center stone aquamarine but a center stone topaz ring of a much lesser value. I even have provided the message from the seller who agrees to refund the {$11000.00}. I'm not confident in the ability of citicard to handle this issue properly. I've been a valued customer for more than 15 years and in those 15 years only two disputes for less than {$40.00}. I was not expecting such poor customer service. 

For additional clarification about this issue, see details below of the opening statement I've provided to Citicard ( additional documentation to support my claim can be provided as needed ) : I've purchased from XXXX XXXX XXXX, owner of XXXX XXXX XXXX, a ring that was sold and advertised as an aquamarine and diamond ring valued at {$68000.00} ( I have the XXXX   appraisal report that XXXX provided as documentation ). The ring was sold to me at {$11000.00}. 
When I received the ring, I had the impression that the center stone was a lot darker than the pictures XXXX XXXX send me and I decided to engage a reputable and certified XXXX appraiser to validate the authenticity of the ring ( XXXX appraisers are the only recognized appraiser service in the country ). When I initially purchase the ring the seller told me that the ring was coming with a XXXX appraisal, not an XXXX appraisal which is the one they  provided. I got nervous and decided to engage a local reputable appraiser. My appraiser documented that the ring was not an aquamarine, but a topaz of a much lesser value and some of the diamonds were questionable. His suggestion was to return the ring because he didnt think this was a reputable seller.The value of the ring based on my private appraisal was approximately {$7900.00} and assumed the diamonds were real, which he doubted strongly but some of them were so small he could not tell. 
After this discovery, I tried to contact the seller without success. The phone number was disconnected. I was able to reach by phone the XXXX appraiser the seller has engaged, who was shocked to hear what happened and ensured me the ring he has appraised was an aquamarine. He also told me he would contact the owner of XXXX XXXX and would make sure he would call me back. 
When I was finally able to talk to XXXX XXXX ( the owner of XXXX XXXX XXXX ) via phone, he said the ring was authentic and ensured me that my appraiser was mistaken. To prove my appraiser wrong, he agreed to do a XXXX appraisal himself, free of charge for me, just to show me that his XXXX appraisal he originally sent was accurate. He also agreed to refund the full {$11000.00} if the ring was in fact a topaz of much lesser value ( I have documentation of this ). I then sent the ring back and was received by XXXX XXXX it on XX/XX/XXXX. 
The XXXX report came back to XXXX XXXX and I got confirmation from him that my appraiser was right : the center stone was in fact a topaz and not an aquamarine. I asked for XXXX XXXX to honor his commitment to refund me the full amount of {$11000.00}. He was apologetic and said he would issue a credit immediately. Since then, not only XXXX XXXX has not returned my messages and calls, but the credit has not been issued, as hes committed to do. Not only he's the ring, but he has my money.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",TX,750XX,,Consent provided,Web,06/19/2018,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,2940046

The person called told me her name was XXXX calling out of XXXX, the exchange starting with XXXX- She express congratulations on our mortgage modifications. Please note the only way to complete the modification according to Mr.Cooper/Nations Star besides complete the trial payments was to pay XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX ( which we did with two separate payments ) one cashier 's check, the other personal check which was cashed/cleared. Both payments were sent via XXXX. Although the person called to express congratulations on the modification she said she was calling to ask if we were behind on any Home Owner Association dues. I gave her the information, Then she told me she was calling about our XX/XX/XXXX payment. I nearly loss it, because these were already sent and we are attempting to move forward. First she stated she could not find any payments we made, then she said she did find it and stated we owed more. After about 15 minutes, she said there is {$110.00} missing and she would put in a request to see what happened to {$110.00}, but she found the two payments. Then she said she could take a payment for XXXX, so I gave her our bank information. The next day I called the number she gave me and said it was her direct line. I called the number and the number was Mr. Cooper but not assign to anyone. Additionally when I called back and spoke to another person she said WE OWED FOR XXXXXXXX,  at this point I hate we have gotten into this type of mortgage with such confusing transactions and inexperienced customer service people who may not have the proper knowledge and abilities when speaking to homeowners on mortgage payments, escrow, taxes and basic customer service. I ended the call and called someone else who again claimed we owed for XX/XX/XXXX. I move the money from my bank account that would have paid XXXX XXXX mortgage because I was told it was for XXXX when I know it should be for XX/XX/XXXX. Afterwards I received repeating emails that our mortgage payment was received numerous times. These are unlimited indications this mortgage company is disconnected and does not know what CS agents are doing in XXXX  versus what those in XXXX are doing ... .several agents swore they knew what they were doing although they could not find the payments I spoke of that was for XXXX and XXXX. I received a letter about a surplus in escrow but would go toward past due payments if the account was not in good standing, the agent told me there was not a surplus because XX/XX/XXXX was not received. These are the types of experiences which makes excuses for them unacceptable. There is still a fact of the XXXX  male called to harass me that I better take the modification then said I decline and the modification was rejected. Even after the recent called congratulating us on the modification, those that I have spoke to within the last two days mentioned the modification was rejected. The person reading this for CFPB it is my hope that you will give further instructions for consumers when mortgage companies like this exist!!!!!!",,NATIONSTAR MORTGAGE,TX,,,Consent provided,Web,06-06-2018,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,2927917

02/20/2018,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an annual escrow account disclosure statement dated XX/XX/XXXX from Lakeview Loan Servicing , LLC. This statement reflected a {$1900.00} shortfall in the escrow account associated with my mortgage, & the mortgage payment was set to increase 27 % from {$660.00} to {$830.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. Property taxes are only {$370.00} per year, & XXXX property hazard insurance was {$2000.00}. {$250.00} of each mortgage payment was being deposited into escrow throughout XXXX, which should have easily covered these amounts for the year. However, after calling Lakeview Loan Servicing 's customer support line ( XXXX ) 3 different times on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX & XX/XX/XXXX, & being placed on hold for over 45 minutes each & every time, Agent #  XXXX ( XXXX ) finally admitted that escrow funds had been misapplied between my escrow account & someone else 's account in early XXXX. After the loan company "" fixed '' their mistake, somehow my escrow account is now nearly {$2000.00} short. They now need to make up the difference over the course of 12 months by raising my overall mortgage payment to a level that is completely beyond my current budget, as my wife has recently become employed again after a long period of unemployment. Although XXXX clearly admitted on a recorded line that the escrow mistake was made on their ( Lakeview Loan Servicing ) end of things, I am still left with them expecting payments exceeding {$800.00} per month beginning XX/XX/XXXX. If I could fire this mortgage company, I would. Apparently raising my mortgage payment by nearly {$200.00} is the only option available to me, even though the mistake was on their end & I have done nothing wrong. I have been offered no other options or detailed explanation, or even an apology for getting my escrow account so out of sorts to begin with. Unfortunately, my plan of action at this point is to pay my normally budgeted mortgage payment of {$660.00} in XXXX, because it is all that I can do. I am sure that the late fees will start piling up, & if it goes on like that long enough, I will end up losing my house over a "" fixed '' mistake that this horrible loan company made with my escrow account.

05/16/2018,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"I submitted a complaint to the NH XXXX DOJ they have tried to help me with XXXX XXXX but was unsuccessful. They suggested I send my complaint to CFPB All of my mortgage payments have been made for the 13 years I have had my mortgage. I have never missed a payment. XXXX XXXX is reporting to the credit bureaus that I have Missed Payments XXXX XXXX admits they would not accept payments during a review process for a loan Modification which spanned over 5 months. How is it okay for them to not accept my payments and to continue to charge me late fees, report missed payments and report late payments. I am believe this to be fraudulent, predatory and unethical. I further believe it is in direct violation of the FCRA. 

XXXX XXXX worked on our modification for 5 months then denied our request for assistance. During that 5 months I initiated communication with them on almost every occasion. On many occasions the application was stalled in one department or another until I initiated contact urging them to move the application along. After 5 months the application was denied because it was deemed our income was too high to qualify for the program, a program which they recommended to us. XXXX XXXX had our income amounts on the first day we submitted the application. Because the process took so long the late fees piled up and the fraudulent credit report continued. XXXX XXXX at inception claimed the process could take as little as 10 days, in our case it was over 140 days. This is a case of a fraudulent Bait and Switch tactic. 

XXXX XXXX reports to the credit bureaus that my payments for XX/XX/2018 to XX/XX/2018 are 120-149 days late these payments were paid in a lump sum in early XXXX the reporting is fraudulent In summary I feel we have been victim of predatory lending, charged illegal fees and are victims of fraudulent reporting to the credit bureaus. These violations are well within your purview. I urge you to request our file from XXXX XXXX, it will show that we pleaded with them to expedite the modification process. Ask XXXX XXXX for the phone transcripts, they will show that they repeatedly lied to us and assured on many occasions that the process would be completed by a certain date which came and went until we again initiated contact. Ask for the original loan documents they refer to, that they allege allows them to not accept payments yet charge late fees and report fraudulently to the credit bureaus. Furthermore, recognize that XXXX XXXX is being sued on a regular basis for its unethically and illegal practices we are another one of their victims. Dont allow them to send you a canned response form letter like they did to the State oh NH DOJ. 

Because of their fraudulent reporting we have recently denied credit 3 times, stuck with them because due to their reporting we are unable to get our loan moved to another lender. 

Lastly, XXXX XXXX offered us a program allegedly to help people in need with unique circumstances after you review our application you be the judge if we fit that criterion, I am confident you will agree we should have been immediately approved or maybe this is yet another predatory program XXXX XXXX is pushing or faking! I realize you cant force an organization to have empathy but I refuse to be taken advantage of! I hope you will agree with me and take this matter further I have appealed to XXXX XXXX senior management and I get the same canned responses.",,"Credit Karma, Inc.",NH,030XX,,Consent provided,Web,05/16/2018,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,2908965

On XX/XX/XXXX I contacted Navient because I had not received any notification of the status of my Consolidation nor my XXXX. I was told at the time that everything was still in process, and that i was given a 30 day Forbearance so that they would have time to process the consolidation and XXXX without penalizing me. 


On XX/XX/XXXX I get a letter in the mail that stated that My loan is due for full repayment within 9 days ( XX/XX/XXXX ). 

On XX/XX/XXXX I contacted Navient. I spoke with XXXX ID # XXXX. She looked into the issue and noticed that ALL my paper work for the consolidation was completed, but for some ODD reason the IBR was not processed, no one in Navient took any action to process it. She stated that all teh IBR documents were present. And that there was no known reason why my IBR should have not been processed. I expressed to her that Navient has a vendetta against me personally because I keep reporting and complaining about how they treat XXXX Americans conservative XXXX. They intentionally mess up my paper work to cause undo hardship and stress upon my life. 

The rep stated that she would expedite the IBR application and would send an email out at that moment as proof of our conversation. I never got the email. She also stated that the expedition would take until XX/XX/XXXX. However I explain to her that the forbearance ends XX/XX/XXXX. I told her that Navient would find a way to penalize me for this issue that was NOT my fault. I also told her that everytime I talk  to someone at Navient, each rep tells me something different about my account situation. 

These people have been lying to me for years. Please help me resolve this issue.",,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",FL,322XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,03-12-2018,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,2841269

03/27/2015,Money transfers,Domestic (US) money transfer,Other transaction issues,,"On XXXX/XXXX/2015 I applied for the Barclay Platinum MasterCard credit card. It was a promotion to transfer a balance with 0 % interest for XXXX billing cycles. I requested a balance transfer of {$10000.00} from another credit card to the new Barclay MasterCard. 
I received the new card on XXXX/XXXX/2015 with a credit limit of {$1500.00}. Because it was not the credit limit I was hoping for I did n't activate the card and was thinking about closing the account. On XXXX/XXXX/2015 I received an email that a {$1000.00} payment posted to the credit card that I asked the {$10000.00} to be transferred to. I still had n't activated the new Barclay card yet and was going to cancel it. 
I called Barclay customer service and told them that the {$1000.00} was an unauthorized transfer and it happened without my knowledge or consent. They waived the {$30.00} transfer fee but told me that they could n't reverse the charges because it was already paid. I advised them that this was unauthorized transfer and that Barclay did it without authorizing it through me and did the transfer anyway and using an arbitrary amount of their own choosing and an amount other than what I agreed to on the application. 

I said that since it was in my mind an unauthorized transaction the responsibility of it falls on them to reverse this transaction and the burden to send them money is not on me. They said no, it could n't be done because it already was processed. I requested the new Barclay MarsterCard account to be closed. 
My point is that since my initial credit card balance was only {$1500.00}, which was way less than the {$10000.00} transfer amount that I requested that the transfer was not going to happen. Furthermore, I had not activated the card and was considering if I was going to keep it or not. 

It is my view that Barclay acted on their own performing transactions without me knowing about it not verifying with me if these were my wishes. If they would have contacted me and asked if I still wanted to transfer a balance since my initial credit line was way smaller than the transfer amount I requested it would have had a very different outcome.

( Attached ) On XX/XX/XXXX late in the afternoon I received phone call from XXXX and she told it seems WFB is returned funds to XXXX and she no further information it was in process. Upon getting further information she promised she will advise me or provide me more information. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I called WFB and it was closed so I left voice mail message for XXXX XXXX to return my phone call. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I called WFB around XXXX XXXX and spoke to staff named XXXX XXXX. I asked to speak to manager I was told hold on he phone and after she came she told me XXXX was answering his phone she had sent and email XXXX has not responded. She than told she will send another email to XXXX lead and than informed lead has not responded to email as well. I than asked to speak to manager again she send another email to manger and than informed manager also did not respond to he email. She than informed me may they all are in meeting and that is why no one respond to he emails. 
I than asked her if she can see anywhere in my accounts funds has been returned to XXXX. I was told no but I was informed my modification documents has not been received by WFB. Told her I have email confirmation on XX/XX/XXXX it  received and XXXX delivery confirmation. At that point she said XXXX was back on his desk and transferred the call to XXXX. 
I asked XXXX about funds being returned to XXXX he explained me my documents was supposed to have been received by XX/XX/XXXX and since it was not received by WFB by XX/XX/XXXX funds was returned to XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. 
I than told XXXX I received an email conformation on XX/XX/XXXX he never stated in his emailed funds were returned on XX/XX/XXXX. I was explained that he never send emails. I told him my email was sent to manger XXXX and it was XXXX who replied conformation. I further told he call me on XX/XX/XXXX which agreed and I told in that recoded conversation he did not mention funds will be returned and documents was supposed to be received by WFB on XX/XX/XXXX. I than told I have received multiple letters mostly from him after XX/XX/XXXX and so do CFPB has received multiple extension none stated funds were returned or will be returned and final date to received modified documents was XX/XX/XXXX. 
I than requested to speak to his mange and XXXX named manager came on line. She told my issues have been almost competed and I should get response in writing soon. She also stated to me final date to received documents was XX/XX/XXXX. I told her multiple and multiple extension has been received in writing, phone calls and through CFPB none stated about final date to receive modification date was XX/XX/XXXX. 
I than told her I received email confirmation on XX/XX/XXXX it did not state final date was XX/XX/XXXX and funds has been returned on XX/XX/XXXX. She again told me funds were returned on XX/XX/XXXX. She further stated to me she will look to entire stuff and get back to me within 24 to 48 hours. She also stated to me investigation into my complaint dose not indicate there was any problem and all payments and other funds have been properly applied. 
I called back to CEO XXXX XXXX office spoke to XXXX she told me I have called multiple times and she will have to transfer call to mortgage corporate office and the call was transferred the call. I spoke to XXXX XXXX explained her of the above she asked me she sits next to XXXX XXXX and she had entire conversation and as sated within 24 to 48 hours above issues will be provided. I than asked her of she fax number so I can send email confirmation her. She did provide me her fax number and phone number. I than requested that please answer my calls and return my messages since XXXX XXXX dose not do that. I did set the fax with email confirmation dated XX/XX/XXXX and received phone call from XXXX. I called him back on XX/XX/XXXX he confirmed to me fax was received on XX/XX/XXXX. 
I again asked XXXX that so many letters was received after XX/XX/XXXX for an extension none sated final date to submit modification documents was XX/XX/XXXX. Neither I was phone discussion with him on XX/XX/XXXX he sated about final date was XX/XX/XXXX. Nor CFPB was informed neither its states in his email funds was returned. He gain reiterated to me he dose not send email and due date was XX/XX/XXXX and funds was returned on XX/XX/XXXX. 
Its over 48 hours I have received no information from WFB. 
I called XXXX spoke to XXXX and she than twisted things little bit and stated to me she was able to see funds being returned on XX/XX/XXXX and funds was received on XX/XX/XXXX. She told me things are done differently in their office it is done electronically. By using electronically funds should not take about one month to be received by XXXX. She did not provide me reason why it took abut one months to received funds. On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX from XXXX also contradicted herself by stating she could see funds being in process of returned but funds was officially returned on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX never stated to me she could funds being returned on XX/XX/XXXX. 
Based on my discussion with XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX I was explained XXXX could see funds are being returned but she had no detail as on that time. My email to her on XX/XX/XXXX confirmation from WFB nothing was stated that on XX/XX/XXXX funds was returned when according WFB funds was returned on XX/XX/XXXX ( Attached ) also she contradicted herself on XX/XX/XXXX she stated she could see funds were being returned on XX/XX/XXXX but did not mention this to me XX/XX/XXXX. 
WFB is involved in corruption letters sent to me, phone calls made to and to CFPB no stated funds were returned or last date was XX/XX/XXXX. There was never at any point of time during my phone conversation, email to manager XXXX, letter I was informed last date to receive documents was XX/XX/XXXX. Email conformation attached was dose not indicates that. About 20 email to XXXX XXXX not even singe was replied what I call BULLING AND CORRUPTION. ( Attached ). XXXX has no excuse and that XXXX XXXX was not getting my email. My email with documents emailed to him in which I asked him to confirm me if entire documents were received and he did. 
Email confirmation which was received on XX/XX/XXXX dose not state funds was returned on XX/XX/XXXX.  DOJ and FBI will be filed complaint to investigate this corruption. 
Even if the funds were returned on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX never received it until XX/XX/XXXX close to one month late. No funds was returned on XX/XX/XXXX but it was received on XX/XX/XXXX and it was re tuned around XX/XX/XXXX. DOJ will and FBI will have investigated this corruption and fraud. It dose not even takes mail to arrive about one month it normally takes 2 days. Here funds were received on XX/XX/XXXX and I have recorded discussion form XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. Its just corruption by WFB. I have recorded conversation with XXXX from XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX she confirmed to me returned funds was received on XX/XX/XXXX. 
BULLING AND ADVANTAGE WFB by holding lien is bulling us which I have stated before and stating this. Now. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I had telephone discussion with XXXX who called me to request for an extension to provide my answers to my dispute items. He did not stated to me in the conversation which is recoded yesterday which was XX/XX/XXXX was last to get the singed documents and it was late. Will provide that recoded conversation. He never stated funds will be returned CORRUPTION AND FRAUD Multiple letters received by XXXX after XX/XX/XXXX dose not states funds was returned because last date to provide singed documents was XX/XX/XXXX. ( Attached ) WFB is taking advantage its position by holding line that they can decided either way and I have to accept it. From XX/XX/XXXX,  XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX I have not received my disputed facts with back up documents why they disagree or agree. 
ONLY THING I HAVE RECEIVED ABOUT 60 EXTENSIONS Like wise my XX/XX/XXXX letter over close to 100 pages has not been received with back up documents why WFB agrees or disagree. Neither they have provided to CFPB. All WFB has done is kept asking for extension and close to 60 extension has been made to provide me an answers. Despite this manger XXXX insisted with me there is nothing wrong with amount and all are correct. Accounts are not the only issues but there are many other issues and manger XXXX is incompetent state to me all are correct. I will prove her wrong if she ones to get 3 party conference with CFPB and Senator XXXX. 
As she stated amounts are correct she must leave WFB for stating amounts are correct when attached documents indicates XX/XX/XXXX payments has not been applied to my account. It indicates its sitting in un applied funds. Manager XXXX is incompetent should reign for providing me wrong information which is recorded. 
Like wise manager XXXX amount on XX/XX/XXXX letter un applied balance was $ {$47.00}, XXXX and modification documents of XX/XX/XXXX was {$73000.00} additional {$25000.00} she just can tell me that is correct but provide me back up copies what extra {$25000.00} has been added for and why. She must provide me beck up documents why {$25000.00} was added so far I have not been provided but illegal, fraud and corruption.
