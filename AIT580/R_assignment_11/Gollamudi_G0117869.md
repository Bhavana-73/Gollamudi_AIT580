## Question 1
Find one example of distortion or unnecessary detail in a visualization (paste the URL of the news page), explain the problem and suggest a solution (5 points).

The above Visualisation was supposed to represent the export pharmaceutical trade around the world. 
### Problems:
* Though the graph shows the data it is neither clear nor efficient in communicating the data. 
* The visualisation tried to depict the Export by changing the size of each country according to export value and using ovals for each country. The map became distorted and hard to visualize.
* Due to this even comparison became difficult. 
* The colours chosen are of the same shade and on top of that they are being depicted on the country flags which leads to change in colour. This is making differentiation between country exports even more difficult.
### Solution:
The better way of representing this data would be with the use of bar or a dot graph and arranging the countries in ascending or descending order. This way the user can identify where each country stands in the ranking of pharmaceutical export. Then the comparison between the country export will also become easy. 
## Question 2
Find one example of misleading interpretation (paste the URL of the news page), explain the problem and suggest a solution (5 points)
### Source:

The above graph is supposed to represent the unemployment rate per month in the year 2011 under the rule of president Obama. But if you closely the graph has been manipulated.
### Problems:
* If you observe the graph you may conclude that there has been a decrease and the slight increase and later a stability in the unemployment rate over the years. 
* if you observe the numbers you can see that there has been a drop in the unemployment in November, but the graph does not represent the same.
### Solution:
According to me the choice of the graph was good, but the plotting of the data was wrong. The visualisation would have been more apt if it communicated the data properly instead of manipulating it. The visualisation can add labels for y axis and add information on even what population of citizens they were considering making it more informative.
